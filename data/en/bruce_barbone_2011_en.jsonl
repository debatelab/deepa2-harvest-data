For nothing is moved except insofar as it is in potentiality with respect to that actuality toward which it is moved, whereas something effects motion insofar as it is in actuality in a relevant respect. After all, to effect motion is just to lead something from potentiality into actuality. But a thing cannot be led from potentiality into actuality except through some being that is in actuality in a relevant respect; for example, something that is hot in actuality \u2013 say, a fire \u2013 makes a piece of wood, which is hot in potentiality, to be hot in actuality, and it thereby moves and alters the piece of wood. But it is impossible for something to be simultaneously in potentiality and in actuality with respect to same thing; rather, it can be in potentiality and in actuality only with respect to different things. For what is hot in actuality cannot simultaneously be hot in potentiality; rather, it is cold in potentiality. Therefore, it is impossible that something should be both mover and moved in the same way and with respect to the same thing, or, in other words, that something should move itself. Therefore, everything that is moved must be moved by another.\nIf, then, that by which something is moved is itself moved, then it, too, must be moved by another, and that other by still another. But this does not go on to infi nity. For if it did, then there would not be any first mover and, as a result, none of the others would effect motion, either. For secondary movers effect motion only because they are being moved by a fi rst mover, just as a stick does not effect motion except because it is being moved by a hand.

{"source_text": "The point of Gettier\u2019 s argument is to show that the concept of knowledge cannot be defined as justified true belief, and Gettier set out to disprove the traditional account of knowledge by showing that there are counterexamples to it. If the traditional account of knowledge is correct, then it is not possible for a person to have a justified true belief that isn\u2019 t knowledge (P1). Since the account maintains that all instances of knowledge are justified true beliefs and vice versa, in order to refute the traditional account, Gettier needed to provide an example of a justified true belief that no one would think is an example of knowledge. In order to understand Gettier\u2019 s counterexample, it is first important to see how advocates of the traditional account understood justified belief. The correct analysis of justification is a matter of great controversy, but as a preliminary attempt it may be helpful to think of a person\u2019 s having a justified belief as that person\u2019 s having some evidence or good reasons to think that the belief is true or likely to be true. Importantly, to have a justified belief, one\u2019 s good reasons do not necessarily need to guarantee that the belief is true. For example, one may be justified in believing that one is seeing a zebra based on the evidence of a black - and - white - striped - equine sensory experience, and one would still be justified, in believing one is seeing a zebra, even if the animal were not a zebra but a cleverly painted mule instead. Consequently, for a belief to be justified, it is not necessary for the belief to be true. As (P2) states, it is possible for one to be justified in believing a false proposition. The next part of Gettier\u2019 s counterexample follows from the principle expressed by (P3): if one is justified in believing some proposition, then one is justified (at least to the same degree) in believing any proposition that one competently deduces from the original one. Since when deductive reasoning is performed competently it preserves truth infallibly, one\u2019 s justification does not diminish across deductive inference. Perhaps this is best illustrated by a variation from one of Gettier\u2019 s examples. Imagine a case where a trustworthy friend, Mr. Nogot, provides sufficiently strong evidence to his friend Jackson for being justified in believing that he (Nogot) owns a Ford. For example, imagine that in addition to his typically trustworthy testimony, Mr. Nogot shows Jackson his registration papers, he takes Jackson for a ride in the Ford, and Jackson has no reason to doubt his testimony or any of the additional evidence that he has to support the proposition that Mr. Nogot owns a Ford. Now, Mr. Nogot does not own a Ford (unbeknownst to Jackson), but this does not prevent Jackson from being justified in believing that Mr. Nogot owns a Ford, since according to (P2) it is possible for a person to be justified in believing a false proposition. And now to the part relevant to (P3) \u2013suppose that as Jackson is pondering his justified belief (that Mr. Nogot owns a Ford) with Mr. Nogot in the room, he deductively reasons that if Mr. Nogot owns a Ford, then someone in the room owns a Ford; therefore, Jackson concludes, someone in the room owns a Ford. On the basis of (P3), Jackson is at least as justified in believing that someone in the room owns a Ford as he is for the proposition that Mr. Nogot owns a Ford since he deduced the former from the latter, which is stated in (C1). The fi nal claim needed to underwrite Gettier\u2019 s counterexample is stated in (P4): If a person is justified in believing a proposition that is true by accident or luck, then her justified true belief is not knowledge. It has already been stipulated that Mr. Nogot does not own a Ford. Now let\u2019 s suppose that at the time that Jackson deductively reasons from the proposition that Mr. Nogot owns a Ford to the proposition that someone in the room owns a Ford, Mr. Havit happens to be the room. Mr. Havit \u2013a person Jackson has never met or has any justification for believing what kind of car he owns \u2013is sitting quietly in the corner of the room, and he happens to own a Ford. So, it turns out that Jackson\u2019 s belief that someone in the room owns a Ford is both justified and true. Recall that it is justified because he deduced it from a proposition that he is justified in believing. The belief is true since Mr. Havit owns a Ford and he is in the room. But since Jackson has no beliefs whatsoever about Mr. Havit, the truth of his justified belief appears to be accidental or lucky. After all, Jackson would have still believed that someone in the room owns a Ford even if Mr. Havit wasn\u2019 t in the room. Thus, it seems that Jackson\u2019 s justified belief is true by luck or accident. In other words, the belief\u2019 s being true has nothing to do with the justification Jackson has for holding the belief. For this reason, it would be wrong to accept that Jackson\u2019 s justified true belief (that someone in the room owns a Ford) counts as knowledge. Since Jackson\u2019 s belief that someone in the room owns a Ford is a justified true belief (C2), and it is plainly wrong to think that it counts as knowledge, Gettier \u2019 s argument is widely accepted as demonstrating why knowledge cannot be defined as justified true belief (C3).", "title": "Gettier\u2019 s Argument against the Traditional Account of Knowledge", "gist": "The bias paradox arises from arguments that reject or decisively revise standard Cartesian conceptions of pure objectivity and impartiality.

{"source_text": "Two expressions are synonymous when sentences containing them remain true when one is substituted for the other, what is here described as interchangebility salva veritate. When applied to necessity statements in English, this view seems to work, since the sentence \u2018Necessarily, every unmarried man is unmarried \u2019and \u201aNecessarily, every bachelor is unmarried\u2019 is a case where truth is preserved when we switch \u2018unmarried man\u2019 for \u2018bachelor\u2019, and these terms are also synonyms. The problem is that such sentences are understood as true in virtue of being analytic.

Because of mathematical evidence (the fact that we know for sure that certain mathematical propositions of second or higher order, e.g., \u201c 3 is a prime\u201c, are true), MP argues that we can infer from the intuition of these propositions being true, first, that we have an intuition that there are abstract objects that give them meaning, and, second, that we have, similarly to the perception of empirical objects, a specific cognitive faculty to perceive abstract objects, without which no intuition would be, cognitively speaking, likely to be possible.", "source_paraphrase": null, "context": "Mathematical Platonism Nicolas Pain", "argdown_reconstruction": "(1) If Mathematical Platonism is true, then, if for any human being there is knowledge of mathematical propositions of second -or higher \u2013 order theory, then this knowledge is grounded on abstract objects.\n(2) If S knows P (a proposition), then S \u2019 s grounds for P are relevantly connected to the fact that p.\n(3) For any X, if X is a spatio - temporal being, and for any Q (a proposition that describes a fact q about an abstract object), then X is not relevantly connected to the fact that q and, therefore, X does not know Q.\n(4) Human beings are spatio - temporal beings.\n-- with modus ponens from (3) and (4) --\n(5) Human beings are not relevantly connected to abstract objects and do not have any knowledge of abstract objects.\n-- with modus tollens from (2) and (5) --\n(6) Human beings do not know any proposition grounded on abstract objects.\n(7) If human beings have knowledge of mathematical propositions of second - or higher - order theory grounded on abstract objects, then human beings possess knowledge of abstract objects.\n-- with modus tollens from (7) and (6) --\n(8) Human beings do not have any knowledge of mathematical propositions of second -or higher - order theory grounded on abstract objects.\n-- with modus tollens from (1) and (8) --\n(9) Mathematical Platonism is not true.", "erroneous_argdown": null, "reasons": [{"text": "[If X knows that p, it] must be possible to establish an appropriate sort of connection between the truth conditions of p (\u2026) and the grounds on which p is said to be known, at least for propositions that one must come to know \u2013 that are not innate.

{"source_text": "A miracle is a violation of the laws of nature [DEF-m]; and as a firm and unalterable experience has established these laws [DEF-l], the proof against a miracle, from the very nature of the fact, is as entire as any argument from experience can possibly be imagined.", "title": "Hume's Argument against Miracles", "gist": "Originally planned to appear in the earlier Treatise of Human Nature (1739\u201340), Hume\u2019s argument against miracles first went to press as Chapter X of An Inquiry concerning Human Understanding in 1748. Since then, mainly as a separate text, it has been granted continued attention. The argument is part of Hume\u2019s philosophy of religion. In particular, it is inserted within a discussion about whether some religious belief could be established by revelation; the argument purports to vindicate a negative answer to this question, by showing that miracles \u2013 the very foundation of revealed religion \u2013 are not (could not be) credible. Importantly, it is independent of any metaphysical claim about whether a miracle is or is not possible, and it is just premised on Hume\u2019s empiricist views in epistemology. \nIt is scarcely controversial, although it has not remained unchallenged (see Swinburne), that Hume\u2019s argument is to be read as addressing the question about whether we could be justified in believing in a miracle on the basis of empirical evidence; in fact, he leaves to a different part of the Inquiry a discussion of whether we could have knowledge of God (and so, on its basis, indirectly of miracles) other than by revelation. It is a bit more controversial, though, whether Hume is trying to establish the conclusion that we could be justified in believing in a miracle on the basis of no empirical evidence whatsoever \u2013 and so, in particular, not even if we had an experience of a miracle \u2013 or the considerably weaker conclusion that we could not be justified in believing in a miracle on the basis of the testimony of others. In what follows, the argument will be presented as it is more customarily discussed, that is, as aimed to establish the weaker conclusion. It is also unclear whether Hume\u2019s argument is meant to be a priori or a posteriori. This difference is worth taking into consideration for the following reason: while many philosophers think that a priori justification is indefeasible by experience, it is quite uncontroversial that a posteriori justification can be so defeated; since the conclusion of an argument cannot be justified more firmly than its premises, this implies that Hume\u2019s argument, depending on whether we read it as a priori or a posteriori, is aimed to establish a conclusion that cannot \u2013 respectively can \u2013 be overturned by further experiences. A possible irenic solution that will be adopted here is to divide Hume\u2019s argument in two parts (corresponding to the parts into which Chapter X is divided) and to read the first of them as aimed to assess the question whether testimony (possibly) justifies belief in a miracle (at least in part) in light of a priori considerations, and to read the second as aimed to assess the very same question in light of additional considerations of a clearly a posteriori nature. As we will see, the (sub)conclusion of the first part is logically weaker than the conclusion of the second. By the same token, the conclusion of the first argument has appeared more resistible than the conclusion of the second. (For this reason, Fogelin contends that Hume just wanted to offer the second argument and not the first.) The first argument purports to show that no testimony could ever provide evidence that is strong enough to undermine our expectation that events that have always been experienced in conjunction with one another will not (and did not) appear in conjunction with one another; the second argument aims just to show that no testimony has provided such evidence. Finally, it is worth mentioning that some controversy surrounds the scope of the conclusion that (the first part of) Hume\u2019s argument, if successful, would actually establish. In particular, it has been suggested that the argument quickly (and undesirably) generalizes to the conclusion that it is always irrational to accept testimony of something which is very unlikely in light of past experience (such as water\u2019s becoming ice, if you live in a very warm region). Hume\u2019s insistence on the distinction among extraordinary (yet natural) events and miracles is often invoked to resist this objection (Levine): given its supernatural origin, a miracle cannot be judged to be analogous to any other event in experience; on the contrary, an extraordinary event can bear the relevant similarity to past experience and then become acceptable by analogy. Yet, it is controversial whether this strategy \u2013 since it implies that Hume\u2019s argument should feature as a premise the claim that we could not have had an experience of a miraculous event

{"source_text": "Does God command something because it is moral, or is something moral because God commands it? In the original context, Euthyphro, a firm believer in the Greek pantheon of gods, argues that the essence of holiness is what the gods love. After Socrates elicits from Euthyphro the admission that the gods, according to legend, could disagree, Euthyphro\u2019s view became that the holy is what all the gods loved and the unholy what all the gods hated. At this point, Socrates shifts gears and introduces the Dilemma, both horns of which are problematic for the theistic ethicist: for either God is merely reporting what\u2019s moral apart from God or God can render as moral whatever God\u2019s whim happens to choose. Many classical theists find both horns of the dilemma unacceptable, because as moral realists they are unwilling to think of morality as infinitely malleable, and as robust supernaturalists they resist the notion that God is essentially irrelevant to a matter so important as moral truth. One common effort at the solution is to disambiguate \u201cmorality\u201d between its deontic and axiological dimensions, distinguishing between obligation and value, and rooting God\u2019s commands only in the former. God\u2019s commands thus provide a way to delimit among what\u2019s good what\u2019s also obligatory, since some such mechanism is necessary because not everything that\u2019s morally good is also morally obligatory (otherwise there would no room for the category of supererogation, moral actions that go above and beyond the call of duty, a category that act utilitarians have a notoriously hard time accommodating). A principled affirmation of divine impeccability (sinlessness) helps resolve arbitrariness and vacuity concerns, because if God is essentially good and loving, then God would never issue commands in irremediable tension with nonnegotiable moral intuitions. A series of six additional distinctions can also be useful in diffusing the Euthyphro Dilemma. A scope distinction between definition and analysis, a semantic distinction between univocation and equivocation, a modal distinction between conceivability and possibility, an epistemic distinction between difficulty and impossibility, a metaethical distinction between knowing and being, and an ontological distinction between dependence and control collectively can enable the theistic ethicist to defend her view against the Euthyphro Dilemma. Therefore, God\u2019s commands can provide the right analysis of moral obligations even if not a definition of \u201cmoral obligation,\u201d which allows atheists to use deontic language meaningfully without believing in God. God would, moreover, retain moral prerogatives that human beings wouldn\u2019t, so God\u2019s behavior, though ultimately recognizable as moral, need not be exactly like human morality (contrary to John Stuart Mill\u2019s claim to the contrary). Although God\u2019s issuing irremediably evil commands is vaguely conceivable, it wouldn\u2019t be genuinely possible; reconciling God\u2019s commands with ineliminable moral intuitions may be difficult but can\u2019t be impossible if it\u2019s rational to believe in God\u2019s moral perfection; and our grasp of necessary moral facts is an epistemic issue that would underdetermine the metaphysical foundations of morality. And finally, the dependence of morality on God does not entail God\u2019s volitional control over the contents of morality to make it just anything at all; divine impeccability would rule some things out. Armed with such distinctions, the theistic ethicist and divine command theorist has not been shown to be irrational in light of the Euthyphro Dilemma.", "title": "Euthyphro Dilemma", "gist": "Antony Flew once said that the test of one\u2019s aptitude in philosophy is one\u2019s ability to grasp the force and point of the \u201cEuthyphro Dilemma,\u201d a traditional objection to theistic ethics traceable to an early Socratic dialogue. The dilemma has long been thought to be an effective refutation of the effort to locate the authority of morality in the will or commands of God (or the gods). In the original context, the dilemma referred to the Greek pantheon of gods and what they loved and hated, whereas in more recent times the formulation is typically in terms of God and God\u2019s commands. The point of the dilemma is that God, even if God exists, does not function as the foundation of ethics. At most, God satisfies a prudential or epistemic function when it comes to morality, but not an ontological one, if the argu- ment goes through.\nAbout halfway into Plato\u2019s Euthyphro, Socrates asks the young Euthyphro a question that has come to be known as the \u201cEuthyphro Dilemma.\u201dIt is scarcely controversial, although it has not remained unchallenged (see Swinburne), that Hume\u2019s argument is to be read as addressing the question about whether we could be justified in believing in a miracle on the basis of empirical evidence; in fact, he leaves to a different part of the Inquiry a discussion of whether we could have knowledge of God (and so, on its basis, indirectly of miracles) other than by revelation. It is a bit more controversial, though, whether Hume is trying to establish the conclusion that we could be justified in believing in a miracle on the basis of no empirical evidence whatsoever \u2013 and so, in particular, not even if we had an experience of a miracle \u2013 or the considerably weaker conclusion that we could not be justified in believing in a miracle on the basis of the testimony of others. In what follows, the argument will be presented as it is more customarily discussed, that is, as aimed to establish the weaker conclusion. It is also unclear whether Hume\u2019s argument is meant to be a priori or a posteriori. This difference is worth taking into consideration for the following reason: while many philosophers think that a priori justification is indefeasible by experience, it is quite uncontroversial that a posteriori justification can be so defeated; since the conclusion of an argument cannot be justified more firmly than its premises, this implies that Hume\u2019s argument, depending on whether we read it as a priori or a posteriori, is aimed to establish a conclusion that cannot \u2013 respectively can \u2013 be overturned by further experiences. A possible irenic solution that will be adopted here is to divide Hume\u2019s argument in two parts (corresponding to the parts into which Chapter X is divided) and to read the first of them as aimed to assess the question whether testimony (possibly) justifies belief in a miracle (at least in part) in light of a priori considerations, and to read the second as aimed to assess the very same question in light of additional considerations of a clearly a posteriori nature. As we will see, the (sub)conclusion of the first part is logically weaker than the conclusion of the second. By the same token, the conclusion of the first argument has appeared more resistible than the conclusion of the second. (For this reason, Fogelin contends that Hume just wanted to offer the second argument and not the first.) The first argument purports to show that no testimony could ever provide evidence that is strong enough to undermine our expectation that events that have always been experienced in conjunction with one another will not (and did not) appear in conjunction with one another; the second argument aims just to show that no testimony has provided such evidence. Finally, it is worth mentioning that some controversy surrounds the scope of the conclusion that (the first part of) Hume\u2019s argument, if successful, would actually establish. In particular, it has been suggested that the argument quickly (and undesirably) generalizes to the conclusion that it is always irrational to accept testimony of something which is very unlikely in light of past experience (such as water\u2019s becoming ice, if you live in a very warm region). Hume\u2019s insistence on the distinction among extraordinary (yet natural) events and miracles is often invoked to resist this objection (Levine): given its supernatural origin, a miracle cannot be judged to be analogous to any other event in experience; on the contrary, an extraordinary event can bear the relevant similarity to past experience and then become acceptable by analogy. Yet, it is controversial whether this strategy \u2013 since it implies that Hume\u2019s argument should feature as a premise the claim that we could not have had an experience of a miraculous event \u2013 creates more problems for Hume\u2019s argument than it helps to solve.", "source_paraphrase": "Is what is holy holy because the gods approve it, or do they approve it because it is holy?", "context": null, "argdown_reconstruction": "(1) What is moral is either moral because God commands it or it is not.\n(2) If what is moral is moral because God commands it, then morality is arbitrary and vacuous.\n(3) If what is moral is moral for reasons other than that God commands it, then God is superfluous from the standpoint of morality.\n-- with Constructive Dilemma from (1) (2) (3) --\n(4) Either morality is arbitrary and vacuous or God is superfluous to morality.", "erroneous_argdown": null, "reasons": [{"text": "Does God command something because it is moral, or is something moral because God commands it", "starts_at": 0, "ref_reco": 1}, {"text": "the holy is what all the gods loved and the unholy what all the gods hated.

{"source_text": "The greatest recent event \u2013 that \u201cGod is dead\u201d; that the belief in the Christian God has become unbelievable \u2013 is already starting to cast its first shadow over Europe. [...] But in the main one might say: for many people\u2019s power of comprehension, the event is itself far too great, distant, and out of the way even for its tidings to be thought of as having arrived yet. Even less may one suppose many to know at all what this even really means \u2013 and, now that this faith has been undermined, how much must collapse because it was built on this faith, leaned on it, had grown on it \u2013 for example, our entire European morality. (\u00a7343)\nWouldn\u2019t the cultivation of the scientific spirit begin when one permitted oneself no more convictions? That is probably the case, only we need still ask: in order that this cultivation begin, must there not be some prior conviction \u2013 and indeed one so authoritative and unconditional that it sacrifices all other convictions to itself? We see that science, too, rests on a faith; there is simply no \u201cpresuppositionless\u201d science. The question whether truth is necessary must get an answer in advance, the answer \u201cyes\u201d, and moreover this answer must be so firm that it takes the form of the statement, the belief, the conviction: \u201cNothing is more necessary than truth; and in relation to it, everything else has only secondary value.\u201d [...] But why not deceive? But why not allow oneself to be deceived? Note that the reasons for the former lie in a completely different area from those for the latter: one does not want to let oneself be deceived because one assumes it is harmful, dangerous, disastrous to be deceived; in this sense science would be a long-range prudence, caution, utility, and to this one could justifiably object: How so? Is it really less harmful, dangerous, disastrous not to want to let oneself be deceived? [...] Precisely this conviction could never have originated if truth and untruth had constantly made it clear that they were both useful, as they are. So, the faith in science, which after all undeniably exists, cannot owe its origin to such a calculus of utility; rather it must have originated in spite of the fact that the disutility and dangerousness of the \u201cwill to truth\u201d or \u201ctruth at any price\u201d is proved to it constantly. [...] Consequently, \u201cwill to truth\u201d does not mean \u201cI do not want to let myself be deceived\u201d but \u2013 there is no alternative \u2013 \u201cI will not deceive, not even myself\u201d; and with that we stand on moral ground. (\u00a7344)\nThus the question \u201cWhy science?\u201d leads back to the moral problem: Why morality at all, if life, nature, and history are \u201cimmoral\u201d? No doubt, those who are truthful in that audacious and ultimate sense which faith in science presupposes thereby affirm another world than that of life, nature, and history; [...] it is still a metaphysical faith upon which our faith in science rests \u2013 that even we knowers of today, we godless anti-metaphysicians, still take our fire, too, from the flame lit by the thousand-year old faith, the Christian faith which was also Plato\u2019s faith, that God is truth; that truth is divine [...] But what if this were to become more and more difficult to believe, if nothing more were to turn out to be divine except error, blindness, the lie \u2013 if God himself were to turn out to be our longest lie? (\u00a7344)", "title": "Nietzsche\u2019s Death of God", "gist": "While Nietzsche resists easy logical formulation, the significance of his critique of the ideas of truth and morality in Western philosophy makes him one of the most important thinkers in modern times. Perhaps no other philosopher has been defined through his legacy as has been Nietzsche: the assault on the metaphysical nature of truth in this argument not only lays foundations for existentialism, poststructuralism, and postmodernism, but it also provides moral philosophy with an emblematic figure of moral skepticism (in the work of MacIntyre or Williams, for example).\nFor Nietzsche, the contemporary age (Northern Europe at the end of the nineteenth century) was witnessing a radical undermining of its philosophical foundations. On the one hand, the traditional beliefs in God were rendered unbelievable by developments in science. But on the other hand, the gap this left in existence had merely being filled by a substitute, science itself, which for Nietzsche maintained the same illusory suppositions over the sacred nature of \u201ctruth.\u201d On the one hand, the rise of the middle classes in the industrial age was undermining traditional structures of society, revealing the importance and malleability of power to the development of humanity. On the other hand, Nietzsche saw that this great shift had produced not radical change but only apathy. The real problem, Nietzsche argued, was not that God had ceased to be believable, but \u2013 given the way\nin which science seamlessly slotted into the same foundational space \u2013 nobody had really noticed the significance of the event. Nietzsche is not a nihilist: for him, the death of God is the greatest event of recent times, enabling \u201cFree Spirits\u201d to throw off their metaphysical shackles and embrace a genuinely open future (although Nietzsche\u2019s \u2013 necessary \u2013 ambiguity over the precise nature of this future has undeniably led to such diverse readings of his work).\n\nHence, despite its subject matter, Nietzsche does not argue for the Death of God itself in his work in a way that would engage traditionally with the philosophy of religion \u2013 it is, rather, a proclamation of an event which is witnessed or reported (for example, in The Gay Science, \u00a7125, \u00a7343, and in the prologue to Thus Spoke Zarathustra). He is more interested in how we, as humans, react to the event: whether we embrace its full significance or continue to place a similar \u201cfaith\u201d in concepts that remain dependent upon the same metaphysical assumptions, such as science and/or morality. Central to these assumptions is the affirmation of \u201canother world,\u201d that of \u201ctruth,\u201d which lies behind our immediate world of experience (for Christianity, this is \u201cheaven\u201d; for morality, the abstract \u201cgood\u201d; for science, atomic structures; and so on). This \u201cbeyond\u201d removes us from our own sensibilities and retains us in a quasi-religious state in reverence to the scientific and/or the moral. Given that such an ordering of the world infects both our language and practice, Nietzsche consequently views the importance of truth as metaphorical rather than rational: the sense we make of the world is always limited by our perspective (indeed, in his early work he argues that truth is itself a mixed metaphorical construction, a point much elaborated on by later poststructuralists), and as such images, figures, and motifs authorize this sense long before we construct a justificatory logic for it. Nietzsche\u2019s style of arguing is at once rigorously philological, tracing the historical development of concepts with intense academic skill, and at the same time almost hopelessly generalizing, aiming broad shots across the bows of our expectations of what a philosophical argument should be. This style must be borne in mind when approaching the logic of Nietzsche\u2019s argument: his argument over the Death of God is far more a polemic than it is an exercise in close reasoning, and at least one of its aims is to open our eyes to a world without fixed parameters of meaning and truth, and in its place, a raw flux of energy and power.\n\nThe majority of people are happy with this, Nietzsche thinks, because they substitute other, more believable principles \u2013 science, morality, and so on \u2013 in the place of \u2018God\u2019s existence\u2019. P2 then becomes an affirmation rather than a negation \u2013 \u2018science is rational\u2019, for example \u2013 albeit creating a fallacy of affirming the consequent. It is these substitutions that Nietzsche sees as remnants of belief that are really challenged by the idea of the Death of God. Thus, Nietzsche is not interested in discussing the existence or nature of God (P2 or C1). His issue is rather with the claim made in P1: our desire to seek a \u201ctruth\u201d in the world beyond our immediate sensations, or, as Nietzsche terms it, the Will to Truth, and why this conditions our lives in the way it does.\n\nAgain, here Nietzsche is using the principles of the Enlightenment (the \u201cscientific spirit\u201d) that knowledge should be objective and without assumptions (or, in Nietzsche\u2019s words, \u201cconvictions\u201d). \u201cWouldn\u2019t the cultivation of the scientific spirit begin when one permitted oneself no more convictions?\u201d But Nietzsche probes this premise, \u201cwe need still ask: in order that this cultivation begin, must there not be some prior conviction \u2013 and indeed one so authoritative and unconditional that it sacrifices all other convictions to itself?\u201d (\u00a7344).\n\nAs Nietzsche reflects, \u201cyou only have to ask yourself carefully, \u2018Why do you not want to deceive?\u2019 especially if it should seem \u2013 and it does seem! \u2013 as if [...] life on the largest scale has actually always shown itself to be on the side of the most unscrupulous polytropoi.\u201d (201) \u201cPolytropoi\u201d means devious, cunning, deceptive. It comes from The Odyssey, where it is used to describe the hero who uses these traits to survive the wrath of the gods. In other words, Nietzsche is suggesting that \u201clife\u201d in general does not favor truth in the way that scientific or moral knowledge seems to.\n\nIn the place of \u201crational\u201d justification, which is but an aspect of the Will to Truth, Nietzsche suggests that \u201ctruth\u201d is merely a guise for the expression of our power. It rests on a metaphysical faith which is no different, at heart, to the Christian belief in God. The Will to Truth is, thus, a means for limiting our expression of such power: this is symptomatic in the \u201cslave morality\u201d of Christianity. With this connection established between science, morality, and faith, Nietzsche returns to the first part of the argument. If God has become unbelievable, then our faith in the divinity of \u201ctruth\u201d is also placed in question.

Something similar applies to inverts and other duplicates. From the conceivability of zombies, proponents of the argument infer their metaphysical possibility.

One evening while the child is taking his bath, Smith sneaks into the bathroom and drowns the child, and then arranges things so that it will look like an accident.\nIn the second, Jones also stands to gain if anything should happen to his six-year-old cousin. Like Smith, Jones sneaks in planning to drown the child in his bath. However, just as he enters the bathroom Jones sees the child slip and hit his head, and fall face down in the water. Jones is delighted; he stands by, ready to push the child\u2019s head back under if it is necessary, but it is not necessary. With only a little thrashing about, the child drowns all by himself, \u201caccidentally,\u201d as Jones watches and does nothing.\nNow Smith killed the child, whereas Jones \u201cmerely\u201d let the child die. That is the only difference between them. Did either man behave better, from a moral point of view? If the difference between killing and letting die were in itself a morally important matter, one should say that Jones\u2019s behavior was less reprehensible than Smith\u2019s. But does one really want to say that? I think not. In the first place, both men acted from the same motive, personal gain, and both had exactly the same end in view when they acted. It may be inferred from Smith\u2019s conduct that he is a bad man, although that judgment may be withdrawn or modified if certain further facts are learned about him \u2013 for example, that he is mentally deranged. But would not the very same thing be inferred about Jones from his conduct? And would not the same further considerations also be relevant to any, modification of this judgment? Moreover, suppose Jones pleaded, in his own defense, \u201cAfter all, I didn\u2019t do anything except just stand there and watch the child drown. I didn\u2019t kill him; I only let him die.\u201d Again, if letting die were in itself less bad than killing, this defense should have at least some weight. But it does not. Such a \u201cdefense\u201d can only be regarded as a grotesque perversion of moral reasoning. Morally speaking, it is no defense at all. [...] I have argued that killing is not in itself any worse than letting die; if my contention is right, it follows that active euthanasia is not any worse than passive euthanasia.", "title": "Rachels on Euthanasia", "gist": "\nActive euthanasia happens when a medical professional or another kind of person deliberately does something that causes a person to die. Passive euthanasia, on the other hand, occurs when someone dies because medical professionals or others don\u2019t do something needed to keep the patient alive. This might include not starting a treatment that would prevent the person\u2019s death or not continuing with a procedure or treatment that is keeping a person or animal alive. Many medical professionals and others think that active euthanasia, even when it is done at the request of the person who dies, is morally wrong. They also think that passive euthanasia is morally right, at least when it is done following the wishes of the person who dies. This idea that the two are ethically different is reflected in the law in many countries. The law makes it a crime to commit active euthanasia but not a crime to perform passive euthanasia when the person who dies doesn\u2019t want to be kept alive. Is this idea about the ethical difference between active and passive eutha- nasia sound? According to Rachels\u2019 argument, it isn\u2019t. There is some ambiguity in the way some parts of the argument are stated. Formalizing the statements in a language for quantified first-order logic would bring out these ambiguities. For example, the final conclusion could mean that active euthanasia is never ethically worse than passive euthanasia, or it could mean that active euthanasia is not always ethically worse than passive euthanasia. It is pretty clear that Rachels has in the mind the second of these two. Again, the intermediate conclusion C1 might mean that killing is never ethically worse than otherwise identical instances of letting die. But Rachels does not intend this. All that he means is that killing is not always worse, morally speaking, than similar cases of letting die. So long as these ambiguities are removed in a consistent way, this argu- ment is deductively valid. So if there is anything wrong with the reasoning, it must be that one or more of the premises are false.

So an abortion infringes on the right to continued life of a person, a human being. Of course the mother has rights too. She has a right to control what is done with and to her own body. Her having an abortion would be an exercise of this right. But the right to continued life is surely more important than anyone\u2019s right to control what is done to his body.

Thomson further says that you obviously have no moral obligation to stay attached to the violinist. The violinist is a human, and so she has a right to continued life, just as the fetus does.

{"source_text": "If a being suffers, there can be no moral justification for refusing to take that suffering into consideration. No matter what the nature of the being, the principle of equality requires that its suffering be counted equally with the like suffering \u2013 insofar as rough comparisons can be made \u2013 of any other being. If a being is not capable of suffering, or of experiencing enjoyment or happiness, there is nothing to be taken into account. This is why the limit of sentience (using the term as a convenient, if not strictly accurate, shorthand for the capacity to suffer or experience enjoyment or happiness) is the only defensible boundary of concern for the interests of others. To mark this boundary by some characteristic like intelligence or rationality would be to mark it in an arbitrary way. Why not choose some other characteristic, like skin color?\nThe racist violates the principles of equality by giving greater weight to the interests of members of his own race, when there is a clash between their interests and the interests of those of another race. Similarly, the speciesist allows the interests of his own species to override the greater interests of members of other species. The pattern is the same in each case. Most humans are speciesists. I shall now briefly describe some of the practices that show this.\nFor the great majority of human beings, especially in urban, industrialized societies, the most direct form of contact with members of other species is at mealtimes: we eat them. In doing so we treat them purely as means to our ends. We regard their life and well-being as subordinate to our taste for a particular kind of dish. I say \u201ctaste\u201d deliberately \u2013 this is purely a matter of pleasing our palate. There can be no defense of eating flesh in terms of satisfy- ing nutritional needs, since it has been established beyond doubt that we could satisfy our need for protein and other essential nutrients far more efficiently with a diet that replaced animal flesh by soy beans, or products derived from soy beans, and other high-protein vegetable products.\nIt is not merely the act of killing that indicates what we are ready to do to other species in order to gratify our tastes. The suffering we inflict on the animals while they are alive is perhaps an even clearer indication of our speciesism than the fact that we are prepared to kill them. ", "title": "The Ethical Vegetarianism Argument", "gist": "The ethics of relations between human and nonhuman animals is a minor topic in the history of Western moral philosophy. Philosophers have given it more attention since the 1970s, when Peter Singer\u2019s work prompted much thinking about the interests of nonhuman animals. Singer\u2019s signature claim is that the same interests of nonhuman animals and humans deserve the same degree of moral consideration. At the time, he pressed the analogy with contemporary liberation movements, saying that nonhuman animals were unfairly denied moral status just as women and people of color had been unfairly denied moral status. However, Singer\u2019s judgments of social status and claims of oppression contribute less to its philosophical merit than the impetus he gave to re-thinking the criteria of basic moral status. The argument presented here makes claims about moral status explicit.\nThis argument has had more influence among nonphilosophers than any philosophical argument of the past fifty years, with the possible exceptions of John Rawls\u2019 A Theory of Justice and Thomas Kuhn\u2019s The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (#90). Although the argument concludes that vege- tarianism is morally required, the considerations adduced in its premises can be extended to moral judgments about using nonhuman animals in research, manufacturing, entertainment, and companionship.\nThe argument for ethical vegetarianism starts by asserting that the ability to suffer is the ground of basic moral consideration. A being deserves basic moral consideration if it deserves consideration for its own sake. In con- trast, something deserves derivative moral consideration if it deserves con- sideration for the sake of something else. The Ethical Vegetarianism Argument aims to show that nonhuman animals deserve basic moral consideration.\nA being deserves basic moral consideration just in case we are morally required to take its interests into account when deliberating about what to do. The ability to suffer is roughly co-extensive with sentience, the capacity to experience pain, pleasure, and frustration and satisfaction of desires. Anything that deserves basic moral consideration is said to have interests. If so, then any being that can suffer has an interest in avoiding suffering. Things that cannot suffer might merit derivative moral consideration even when they do not merit consideration for their own sakes.\nKnowing that a being deserves moral consideration is necessary but not sufficient for moral judgment. In addition, we need to know how various beings\u2019 interests stand in relation to one another. The Equal Consideration of Interests Principle is an independent premise telling us that interests themselves are equal, regardless of the kind of being that has the interests. Thus, the Equal Consideration of Interests Principle asserts that the crite- rion of moral consideration, the ability to suffer, applies to both nonhuman and human animals. Thus, the same suffering ought to have the same weight in judging the rightness or wrongness of our actions, whether a human nonhuman animal experiences that suffering.\nThe argument derives C3 from P4 and P5, concluding that causing a being to suffer without adequate justification is morally wrong. P6 and P7 apply the Equal Consideration of Interests Principle, stated in P3, and C3 to eating meat, concluding that doing so is morally wrong. The premises introduce the factual claims that industrial production of meat involves confining, killing, and causing animals to experience pain and that by eating meat one participates in confining, killing, and causing pain.\nSinger\u2019s earliest statement of the argument is his \u201cAll Animals Are Equal,\u201d published in 1974 in Philosophical Exchange.

Now we know that most bats (the microchiroptera, to be precise) perceive the external world primarily by sonar, or echolocation, detecting the reflections, from objects within range, of their own rapid, subtly modulated, high frequency shrieks. Their brains are designed to correlate the outgoing impulses with the subsequent echoes, and the information thus acquired enables bats to make precise discriminations of distance, size, shape, motion, and texture comparable to those we make by vision. But bat sonar, though clearly a form of perception, is not similar in its operation to any sense that we possess, and there is no reason to suppose that it is subjectively like anything we can experience or imagine. This appears to create diffi culties for the notion of what it is like to be a bat. [ . . . ] Whatever may be the status of facts about what it is like to be a human being, or a bat, or a Martian, these appear to be facts that embody a particular point of view. [ . . . ] This bears directly on the mind \u2013 body problem. For if the facts of experience \u2013facts about what it is like for the experiencing organism \u2013are accessible only from one point of view, then it is a mystery how the true character of experiences could be revealed in the physical operation of that organism. The latter is a domain of objective facts par excellence \u2013the kind that can be observed and understood from many points of view and by individuals with \ndiffering perceptual systems.
